# Uric Acid Gene Cluster Analysis in Human-Associated Microbiomes

This repository contains all code and resources used to identify, analyze, and visualize uric acid-degrading microbial populations from over 340,000 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) sourced from global microbiome catalogs (UHGG, GEM, KJI). This project expands the known phylogenetic and ecological landscape of uric acid degradation by combining genomic annotation, local sequence similarity searches, and KEGG-based functional enrichment analyses.
